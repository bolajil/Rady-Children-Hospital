## Asthma in Pediatric Patients

### Overview
Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease of the airways that affects millions of children worldwide. It is characterized by recurrent episodes of wheezing, breathlessness, chest tightness, and coughing.

### Pathophysiology
Asthma involves:
- Airway inflammation
- Bronchial hyperresponsiveness
- Variable airflow obstruction
- Airway remodeling in severe cases

### Symptoms
**Common symptoms in children:**
1. Persistent Coughing - especially at night or during exercise
2. Wheezing - a whistling sound when breathing
3. Shortness of Breath - difficulty breathing
4. Chest Tightness - feeling of pressure in the chest
5. Difficulty Breathing - particularly during physical activity
6. Fatigue - due to poor sleep from nighttime symptoms

**Red Flags (seek immediate care):**
- Severe difficulty breathing
- Blue lips or face
- Rapid breathing
- Inability to speak in full sentences
- Chest retractions

### Diagnosis
Diagnostic criteria include:
- Clinical history and physical examination
- Spirometry (for children ≥5 years)
- Peak flow measurements
- Exercise challenge tests
- Allergy testing

### Treatment
**Step-wise approach:**

**Step 1 (Intermittent):**
- Short-acting beta-agonist (SABA) as needed
- Example: Albuterol inhaler

**Step 2 (Mild Persistent):**
- Low-dose inhaled corticosteroid (ICS)
- Plus SABA as needed

**Step 3 (Moderate Persistent):**
- Low to medium-dose ICS + long-acting beta-agonist (LABA)
- Or medium-dose ICS alone

**Step 4 (Severe Persistent):**
- Medium to high-dose ICS + LABA
- Consider add-on therapy (leukotriene modifier, theophylline)

### Triggers
Common asthma triggers in children:
- Respiratory infections (especially viral)
- Allergens (dust mites, pets, pollen, mold)
- Exercise
- Cold air
- Air pollution
- Tobacco smoke
- Strong emotions

### Prevention
**Environmental control:**
- Reduce dust mites exposure
- Avoid tobacco smoke
- Control indoor humidity
- Regular cleaning
- Pet management if allergic

### Medication Safety
**Important considerations:**
- Proper inhaler technique is crucial
- Spacers recommended for young children
- Regular follow-up to assess control
- Written asthma action plan for all patients

### Prognosis
- Many children improve or outgrow asthma
- Good control reduces long-term complications
- Early intervention is key

## Common Pediatric Medications

### Albuterol (Salbutamol)
**Class:** Short-acting beta-2 agonist (SABA)

**Indications:**
- Acute asthma exacerbations
- Exercise-induced bronchospasm
- Wheezing

**Pediatric Dosing:**
- Inhaler (MDI): 2 puffs every 4-6 hours as needed
- Nebulizer: 0.15 mg/kg (minimum 2.5 mg) every 20 minutes x 3 for severe exacerbation

**Side Effects:**
- Tachycardia
- Tremor
- Hyperactivity
- Headache

**Contraindications:**
- Hypersensitivity to albuterol

## Clinical Guidelines Summary

### American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) Asthma Management

**Control Assessment:**
- Well-controlled: <2 days/week daytime symptoms, <2 nights/month nighttime awakening
- Not well-controlled: >2 days/week symptoms
- Very poorly controlled: Throughout the day symptoms

**Step-Up Therapy Indications:**
- Symptoms >2 days/week
- Nighttime awakening >1x/month
- Interference with normal activities
- Exacerbations requiring oral corticosteroids ≥2x/year

**Step-Down Therapy:**
- Consider after 3 months of good control
- Reduce dose by 25-50%
- Continue monitoring
