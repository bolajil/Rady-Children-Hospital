Pediatric Asthma Treatment Guidelines
--------------------------------------

Introduction
------------
Asthma is one of the most common chronic diseases in children. This document provides evidence-based guidelines for the treatment and management of pediatric asthma.

Classification
--------------
Asthma severity is classified into four categories:
1. Intermittent
2. Mild Persistent
3. Moderate Persistent
4. Severe Persistent

Treatment Approaches
--------------------

For Intermittent Asthma:
- Short-acting beta-agonists (SABA) as needed
- No daily controller medication required
- Monitor symptoms and lung function

For Mild Persistent Asthma:
- Low-dose inhaled corticosteroids (ICS)
- Alternative: Leukotriene receptor antagonist (LTRA)
- SABA as rescue medication

For Moderate Persistent Asthma:
- Medium-dose ICS OR low-dose ICS + long-acting beta-agonist (LABA)
- Consider adding LTRA
- Regular follow-up every 3-6 months

For Severe Persistent Asthma:
- High-dose ICS + LABA
- Consider oral corticosteroids if needed
- Specialist referral recommended
- Biologic therapies may be considered

Emergency Management
--------------------
For acute exacerbations:
1. Administer oxygen if SpO2 < 90%
2. SABA via nebulizer or MDI with spacer
3. Systemic corticosteroids (oral prednisolone or IV methylprednisolone)
4. Monitor response and consider additional bronchodilators
5. Admit if no improvement or severe symptoms

Important Considerations for Children
--------------------------------------
- Growth monitoring is essential for children on long-term ICS
- Proper inhaler technique must be taught and regularly assessed
- Spacers should be used with MDIs for children under 5 years
- Asthma action plans should be provided to all families
- School notifications and emergency medications should be arranged

Prevention and Environmental Control
-------------------------------------
- Identify and avoid triggers (allergens, irritants)
- Ensure influenza vaccination annually
- Consider allergen immunotherapy for specific sensitivities
- Maintain smoke-free environment
- Regular cleaning to reduce dust mites and mold

Follow-up and Monitoring
------------------------
- Regular assessment of symptoms and lung function
- Peak flow monitoring for children over 5 years
- Medication adherence review
- Inhaler technique check at each visit
- Update asthma action plan as needed
